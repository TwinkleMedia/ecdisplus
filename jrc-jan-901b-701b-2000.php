            <P> The ECDIS system is offered in both stand-alone and desktop versions to accommodate different vessel
                types. The desktop version features a central processor unit that serves as the JAN-901B core of the
                system, enabling flexible installation in space-restricted areas. The JAN-901B is an advanced
                multi-functional ECDIS designed with ergonomic precision to optimize the working environment and improve
                man/machine interaction. It offers continuous position tracking and navigational safety information to
                ensure seamless and reliable maritime operations. With the new JAN-901B ECDIS series, you have four
                system options to choose from. Available in both desktop and stand-alone versions, these options are
                designed to accommodate your preferred installation method perfectly. The advanced JAN-901B ECDIS system
                offers versatile route planning options. You can plan your route using the table editor while displaying
                the current waypoint, or graphically draw your waypoints directly on the chart. Editing routes is just
                as straightforward as creating them, thanks to dedicated menus designed to assist mariners in effective
                route planning. Additionally, you can save routes and import your favorite or frequently used files,
                including those from previous ECDIS models, using the industry-standard CSV format.</P>
