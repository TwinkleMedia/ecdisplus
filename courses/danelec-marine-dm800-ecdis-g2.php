                <p>The objectives of this course are to cover type-specific familiarisation of ECDIS tailored to the
                    specific needs of the Navigational Officers. Subject areas covered in the course include an overview
                    of ECDIS carriage requirements, electronic charts, ECDIS navigational functions, ship handling with
                    ECDIS, sensor integration, alert management, as well as the latest changes according to the new IHO
                    and IEC standards. Combined the content of this course ensures that officers understand the
                    type-specific navigational functions of ECDIS, and are familiar with the features that are common to
                    all ECDIS systems before boarding a vessel, which ultimately translates to safer operations and
