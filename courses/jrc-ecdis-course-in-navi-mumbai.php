                <p>The JRC type-specific training course equips officers with the necessary system knowledge to
                    effectively use this ECDIS for watchkeeping, in compliance with STCW and ISM Code regulations. This
                    guided tutorial, approximately 16 hours long, fulfills the equipment familiarization requirements of
                    IMO Model Course 1.27 and MCA MIN-503(M) for the JAN-9201/7201 ECDIS functions and controls. Upon
                    booking the course, you are allotted a three-week period to complete it, allowing for the repetition
                    of modules as needed, and access to the “FreePlay” Mode, which enables free practice on the
                    manufacturer’s original, type-approved software. The courseware culminates in a final test, lasting
                    no more than one hour, which can be retaken if necessary, leading to an individual certificate.</p>

                <h2 class="info-card-title"><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Course Objectives</h2>
                <p>The course aims to provide type-specific familiarization with ECDIS tailored to the needs of
                    Navigational officers. It covers essential areas such as an overview of ECDIS carriage requirements,
                    electronic charts, navigational functions of ECDIS, ship handling with ECDIS, sensor integration,
                    alert management, and the latest updates in IHO and IEC standards. This comprehensive training
                    ensures that officers thoroughly understand the specific navigational functions of ECDIS and become
                    familiar with common features across all ECDIS systems. This preparation ultimately contributes to
                    safer vessel operations and more effective maneuvering.</p>

                <p>The Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) is a geographic information system
                    designed for voyage planning and route monitoring, enhancing the safety of maritime navigation. The
                    ECDIS onboard a ship integrates images from the automatic identification system (AIS), radar system,
                    and collision avoidance target tracking (TT) system, overlaying them with navigational chart
                    information to accurately display dynamic data about nearby vessels. It plays a central role in
                    ensuring safe navigation by providing safety functions such as generating warnings when the ship
                    approaches hazardous areas. ECDIS is essential for marine accident avoidance and is a critical tool
                    for the safe navigation of ships.

                    In response to the latest revision of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea
                    (SOLAS), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandated the installation of ECDIS on
                    oceangoing passenger ships of 500 gross tons or more, and on tankers and cargo ships of 3,000 gross
                    tons or more, in a phased approach starting July 2012. This regulation stipulates that if a ship
                    uses ECDIS as its primary navigational equipment, it must also have conventional paper charts or an
                    additional ECDIS as a backup. Equipment and operational qualifications must be approved by the flag
                    state and adhere to recommendations from the ship's classification society. ECDIS is essential for
                    marine accident avoidance and is a crucial tool for ensuring the safe navigation of ships.

                    The JAN-9201/7201 features an innovative user interface (named jGUI), which offers an intuitive and
                    user-friendly menu system based on icon displays. The ECDIS can be operated similarly to
                    conventional models by connecting an optional operating unit that includes dedicated function
                    buttons, control knobs, and a full QWERTY keyboard.

                    JRC's new ECDIS model JAN-9201/7201 has integrated route editing, and combines what was previously
                    two separate segments—graphic input and numeric table input—into a unified system. Waypoints
                    specified on the navigational chart are instantly quantified and added to the numeric</p>
