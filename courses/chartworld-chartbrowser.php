            <p>ChartBrowser is a versatile application offering a catalogue of custom digital charts. It enables users
                to import, calculate, or manually create routes, select charts based on these routes, manage existing
                chart inventories, and create basket files for ordering selected products directly from ChartWorld.
                Orders can be executed online via email, straight from your vessel. This data can then be exported for
                use in ECDIS/ECS systems. Additionally, the digital chart catalogue can be automatically updated using
                the ChartWorld update service. ChartBrowser is a complimentary onboard solution that supports all
                official ENC formats from UKHO, Primer, and IC-ENC, as well as the ACES (S)ENC format for eGlobe,
                S-ECDIS, and Imtech ECDIS. Since it can be used with any ECDIS model on the market, it is particularly
                beneficial for shipping companies operating fleets with multiple ECDIS manufacturers, as noted by the
                supplier.</p>

                Everyone is talking about paperless navigation, but if it takes more time to order charts and manually
                install update CDs than correcting paper charts. ChartBrowser is available in three different modes:
                Vessel Operation Mode: Used aboard a vessel to order and update charts online via email communication.
                Shipping Company Mode: Used at the shipping company to verify orders from the vessels. Standard Mode:
                Used to manually generate orders without any online order/updating facility. To get a free copy of
                ChartBrowser and learn how to efficiently manage your ECDIS/ECS data coverage for your navigation
                systems, please register below. Before installing ChartBrowser, we recommend removing previous versions.
                While paperless navigation is widely discussed, if ordering charts and manually installing update CDs
                takes longer than correcting paper charts, there's a problem with your ENC work process.

                In addition, the following features are provided:


                . Weekly Updates: Receive ECDIS chart updates, NtM updates, and product catalog updates on a weekly
                basis.
                . Easy Data Export: Combine all received ECDIS chart updates (AVCS, AIO) into a single 'exchange set.'
                This cumulative set includes all updates received since the last registered AVCS media state, allowing
                for simple import into the ECDIS rather than processing individual weekly updates.
                . Automatic Route Management: Automatically generate routes and collect chart products for routes
                traversed.
                . Email-Based Ordering: Send online chart orders and receive chart data permits via email.
                . Budget Management: Manage vessel budgets for chart product orders and other nautical publications.
                . Automated Inventory Maintenance: Keep track of inventory with automated updates.
                . Port and Terminal Database: Access a port and container terminal database with over 4,000
                destinations.
                . Data Request Automation: ChartBrowser automatically scans for missing data (e.g., chart updates not
                received via satellite) and requests it from the ChartWorld Server.
                . Update Status Reports: Automatically generate (and print) Update Status Reports for the ENC portfolio,
                detailing the latest S-57 edition, update number, and receipt date. Includes data export and AVCS media
                volume information, with outdated charts clearly indicated.
                . NtM Update Reports: Generate weekly NtM update reports, including print options for tracings,
                diagrams, and block charts. A retrospective eNtM database allows for reloading and viewing of older
                NtMs, with options to mark NtMs as 'Applied' for paper charts to avoid reloading.
