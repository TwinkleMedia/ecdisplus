            <p>System Overview The Simrad MARIS ECDIS900 complies with the IMO's ECDIS performance standards and is
                designed to interface seamlessly with other navigational equipment. This integration enhances the Watch
                Officer's ability to safely navigate and manage information. The ECDIS900 operates on Windows operating
                systems, providing a user-friendly platform for efficient navigation. System Components Software
                Components Application Manager: The Application Manager is a Windows shell installed by default on ECDIS
                computers. It allows users to manage and access the start menu, taskbar, and system trays. This
                component provides a standard desktop environment and a graphical user interface for file management
                functions within the Windows operating system. Basic Operation Start-up: To power on the ECDIS900
                system, press the external power switch on the MK15 or MK5 computers. The system should remain powered
                on at all times. Upon powering up, the operating system will start automatically, followed by the system
                program.

                Technical Manual STANDARD MARIS ECDIS900 INSTALLATION. The standard installation of the MARIS ECDIS900
                consists of two workstations connected via LAN: the monitoring workstation and the planning workstation,
                which serves as a backup. This chapter covers: Monitoring and Planning Workstations [Additional topics
                can be listed here.] To exit the ECDIS900 application, the computer should be either switched off or
                rebooted. These operations can be performed through the Application Manager. Backup: Regular backups are
                essential. For detailed instructions, refer to the Maris ECDIS900 Backup/Restore Procedures User Guide.
                MARIS ECDIS900 Installation Manual DUAL ECDIS MINIMUM CONFIGURATION. This configuration is commonly used
                on most ships and meets the IMO's minimum requirements for operating paperless navigation systems. In
                this setup, mandatory signals are hardwired to each computer, ensuring that a failure in one unit does
                not impact the functionality of the remaining equipment, which will continue to operate fully. MARIS
                ECDIS900 Installation Manual. Other equipment can be powered from the same source or from an alternative
                one. However, do not power the ECDIS900 from the Lighting Switchboard, as it may not be connected to the
                emergency diesel generator. Powering from the Lighting Switchboard could result in the class society or
                flag state rejecting the installation and denying final approval.

            <p>The ECDIS system is a type-approved Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) that meets
                International Maritime Organization (IMO) requirements for vessels subject to SOLAS regulations. It
                displays the vessel's position, speed, and course in real-time on the chart, using data from
                navigational sensors. The vessel’s symbol is shown with its actual heading, and speed vectors can also
                be displayed. Critical chart information essential for safe navigation, as defined by IMO, is always
                visible, while other chart details can be toggled on or off as needed. Both the hardware and software of
                this ECDIS are type-approved. Type approval certificates can be accessed on the product page. The
                operational range of this ECDIS, using ENC charts, extends between latitude 85° N and 85° S. The system
                complies with the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) standards, which are also available.
